This is a python script that allows you to use <<[T h e S u p e r i o r S c a l e]>> a scale based on the roman alphabet, consonants vs vowels, and my madness, to represent a number of any size as a small number and a magnitude name. 
Scales (haha get it) infinitely and each name is technically differentiable and pronounceable.
